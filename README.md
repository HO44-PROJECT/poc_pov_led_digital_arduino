# Railway HO project - Signals - POV lamp effect prototype using Arduino digital output

This code demonstrates how to apply a "lamp" effect on any LED using digital output
Based on POV, it gives the human eye the impression of a fading effect
Required material: arduino. I'm using a nano
A LED with its resistor
