Railway HO project - Signals - POV lamp effect prototype using Arduino digital output
https://github.com/Jacques44/dcc_railway_arduino
This code demonstrates how to apply a "lamp" effect on any LED using digital output
Based on POV, it gives the human eye the impression of a fading effect
Required material: arduino. I'm using a nano
A LED with its resistor

# Setup

Connect a LED using a resistor in series to a digital PIN. I use pin 4
You can use

Upload the code

# Demo
